\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Oregon State University, researching novel user interfaces for version control tools and software development environments. I have 6+ years experience specializing in front-end development, infrastructure automation, and technical support. I'm interested in software developer roles that can leverage my expertise in Git, CI/CD, and program analysis/transformation to support people. I believe people are the heart of any software solution, and focusing on the user is paramount for developing software that is enjoyable  to use. I've previously worked in healthcare IT, and interned at Microsoft, Intel, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

\lettersection{Why \company?}
I believe software technology is disrupting the traditional barriers between personal finance and the finance industry at large. 
The proliferation of mobile banking, cashless transactions, automated loan processing, and similar technologies is enabling the end-user to become their own financial manager. So needless to say, providing insights into how to manage debt is definitely a needed product, and Beyond Finance appears posed to tackle that area head on. I enjoy managing my own financial data, and cobbling together my own software to ingest and manage that data, but would also love to bring that attention to detail to bear at Beyond.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've spent the last 5 years developing tools for software developers using React, TypeScript, and NodeJS. These tools primarily focus on bringing the complexities of Git down to a level where novices and power-users are both capable of making informed decisions quickly in large software projects. My expertise transcends programming languages and focuses on using the correct tool for each problem, but I've spent considerable time using React Hooks, Redux state management, MUI styled-components, the ESLint static analyzer, and Jest and React Testing Library (RTL) testing frameworks. In past projects, I've also used Ruby on Rails for developing interactive web applications to display developer metrics that show conformance (or non-conformance) to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) model.

I would love to further discuss how my background and skills can fit the needs of \company.
